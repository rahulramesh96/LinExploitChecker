# LinExploitChecker

Detecting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Linux machines can be a complex task that depends on several factors such as the distribution, kernel version, installed packages, etc. However, there are some common vulnerabilities that you can check for using the following Python script. 


This script checks for two common vulnerabilities: SUID binaries with known vulnerabilities and writable directories with sticky bits set. The script walks through the file system starting from the root directory and checks for the presence of the vulnerable binaries and directories.



```
$ sudo python3 privilege_escalation_detector.py

```
